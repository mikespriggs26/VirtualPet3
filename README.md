This program will show the owner of a diabetic dog what the dog's current hunger, water, and insulin levels are.
The owner will have the opportunity to give food, water or an insulin shot.  Those actions will influence and adjust
the appropriate levels.  At the same time, the levels are dropping on their own as the dog naturally gets hungrier, thirstier
and needs more insulin. The user will always have a new set of data to evaluate when choosing how to care for the dog.
